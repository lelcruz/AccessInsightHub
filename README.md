# Accessibiliy Portal

**Authors:** Leslie Cruz, Ngoc Yen Nhi Ha, Shane Luong, Sienna Newby-Sanchez

**Description:**  
Persons with disabilities are widely distributed around the world, as are accessibility researchers and companies who require feedback from these individuals in order to improve or design their projects. This portal will provide a platform for those who need to conduct focus groups, surveys, and studies to present opportunities for persons with disabilities to participate. This includes details about whether the opportunity is online or in-person, whether it is compensated, etc. Through this portal, persons with disabilities will be able to receive notifications about opportunities that are of interest to them, as well as directly contact those running the opportunities

The portal is designed with the following goals:

	a. To be accessible to blind and visually impaired individuals, as well as those with other disabilities.
	b. To provide easy navigation and suggested templates for researchers to post surveys and other study opportunities.
	c. To have a responsive and consistent user interface that runs well on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.
	d. To provide a secure website for storing the information of users who post studies or are potential survey participants.
	c. To enable participants to contact the authors of the studies they are interested in by messaging via the portal.
	d. To notify potential participants if there is a post that matches their interested types of studies. 

As the portal is used to gather feedback from individuals with disabilities, it is necessary to follow best practices for accessibility guidelines. Users can browse studies on the website without creating an account, but an account is required to use any other features.
